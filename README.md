Elastic Home SIEM Lab

[Objective]

In this guide, I’ll walk you through everything I learned while setting up a home lab for Elastic Stack SIEM using the Elastic Web portal and a Kali Linux VM. You’ll see how I configured the Kali VM to generate security events, set up an agent to forward data to the SIEM, and used Elastic’s querying tools to analyze the logs.
